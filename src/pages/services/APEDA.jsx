          The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) 
          was established by the Government of India through the Agricultural and Processed 
          Food Products Export Development Authority Act, which was passed by Parliament in 
          December 1985. The Act (No. 2 of 1986) came into effect on 13th February 1986, as 
          notified in the Gazette of India: Extraordinary, Part-II, Section 3(ii), dated 
          13.02.1986. APEDA replaced the Processed Food Export Promotion Council (PFEPC) and 
          has since been entrusted with the responsibility of promoting and developing exports 
          of various agricultural and processed food products.

          APEDA also serves as the Secretariat to the National Accreditation Board (NAB) for 
          implementing the accreditation of Certification Bodies under the National Programme 
          for Organic Production (NPOP). As per the NPOP, organic products meant for export 
          must be produced, processed, and packaged in accordance with the standards set out 
          in the official NPOP document. Furthermore, pursuant to the Directorate General of 
          Foreign Trade (DGFT) Notification No. 6/2015-2020 dated 14th June 2021, products 
          such as cashew kernels, cashew nut shell liquid, and cardanol now fall under the 
          jurisdiction of APEDA.
