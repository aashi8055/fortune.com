          The BHOG initiative encourages places of worship to adopt and maintain
          food safety and hygiene in the preparation, serving, and sale of
          prasad. It also involves the training of food handlers in basic food
          safety and hygiene.

          Under the BHOG initiative, places of worship where prasad is
          cooked or handled are identified, and audits are conducted to ensure
          safety standards. Basic training is provided to food handlers to
          maintain hygiene practices.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          After a successful audit of the place of worship, it becomes recognized
          and certified for maintaining food safety and hygiene.
