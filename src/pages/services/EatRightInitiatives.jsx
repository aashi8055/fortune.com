          FSSAI has embarked on a large-scale effort to transform the country’s
          food system in order to ensure safe, healthy, and sustainable food for
          all Indians. ‘Sahi Bhojan. Behtar Jeevan’, thus, forms the foundation
          of Eat Right India initiatives.

          These initiatives aim to promote both the demand for and the supply of
          safe and healthy food in a sustainable way. While the supply-side
          interventions are aimed at building capacities of food businesses to
          promote self-compliance, the demand-side initiatives work towards
          motivating consumers to demand safe and healthy food.

        <p className="text-gray-700 text-base leading-relaxed">
          The initiatives for the production and consumption of food in a
          sustainable way are aimed at promoting environment-friendly food
          practices and habits.
