          To strengthen the food safety surveillance system, FSSAI has envisaged
          audits of Food Business Operators (FBOs) through private auditing
          agencies. In order to cultivate and foster the growth of compliance
          culture, FSSAI is enabling compliance through recognized private
          auditing agencies.

          Food Safety Audits aim to reduce regulatory inspections by Central or
          State Licensing Authorities. Satisfactory audits will result in fewer
          inspections, except for regulatory sampling. This strengthens the food
          safety surveillance system, encourages self-compliance, and assures
          consumers of safe food.
