          ISO 15378 is an international standard that outlines specific requirements for the
          application of ISO 9001:2015 in the context of Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) for
          primary packaging materials used in medicinal products. The standard is intended for
          organizations that must demonstrate their ability to consistently supply primary packaging
          materials that meet both customer and regulatory requirements, as well as relevant
          international standards.

          Primary packaging refers to the materials that come into direct contact with the medicinal
          product. Also known as consumer or retail packaging, its primary function is to protect,
          preserve, contain, and provide essential information about the product to the consumer.
          Because these materials interact directly with the product, they are classified as critical
          raw materials in pharmaceutical manufacturing and must be strictly monitored. ISO 15378
          offers a comprehensive framework that enables organizations to prove their capability to
          supply high-quality, compliant packaging materials that adhere to strict regulatory
          expectations and international best practices.

          Certification to ISO 15378 helps organizations implement robust risk management by
          identifying, controlling, and mitigating risks within the production of primary packaging
          materials. It provides clear evidence of adherence to quality, manufacturing, and safety
          standards. Because the standard is aligned with ISO 9001, it allows certified companies to
          efficiently implement a recognized quality management system while meeting additional
          GMP-specific requirements.

          This certification also strengthens brand protection by demonstrating a companyâ€™s
          commitment to quality to both the public and stakeholders. It supports regulatory
          compliance by aligning operations with legal and industry-specific requirements.
          Furthermore, ISO 15378 focuses on client satisfaction by facilitating continuous
          improvement and ensuring the consistent fulfillment of client expectations.

          A key feature of this standard is its integration of GMP principles, ensuring that the
          packaging materials used for medicines meet the highest standards of safety and
          effectiveness.
