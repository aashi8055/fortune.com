          BSCI, which stands for Business Social Compliance Initiative, is a globally recognized
          framework developed by Amfori to promote ethical and responsible business practices across
          complex international supply chains. The Amfori BSCI Code of Conduct is grounded in
          internationally accepted conventions such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
          the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, the Childrenâ€™s Rights and
          Business Principles, OECD Guidelines, the UN Global Compact, and International Labour
          Organization (ILO) Conventions and Recommendations. These foundational documents
          collectively aim to improve working conditions throughout the supply chain, particularly in
          factories producing goods for global brands and retailers.

          The core objective of Amfori BSCI is to elevate social performance within the
          manufacturing and sourcing processes of businesses. As global demand for responsible
          sourcing intensifies, retailers and brands are increasingly focused on building ethical
          supply chains. The BSCI framework supports this shift by offering a robust social auditing
          structure that enables transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.

          Organizations that implement the BSCI standard benefit in several ways. It ensures
          compliance with both international and national labor regulations, thereby enhancing
          corporate credibility and trust. It also facilitates stronger relationships with customers
          and provides access to new business opportunities, particularly with international and
          European retailers where BSCI certification often serves as a pre-qualification
          requirement. Additionally, companies can obtain waivers for customer-specific codes of
          conduct audits, simplifying compliance efforts and reducing audit fatigue.

          The Amfori BSCI Code of Conduct places strong emphasis on labor rights and social
          protections within the workplace. Key focus areas include the establishment of effective
          social management systems and the promotion of a cascading effect throughout the supply
          chain. Worker involvement and protection are integral components, along with the rights to
          freedom of association and collective bargaining. The standard prohibits discrimination,
          child labor, precarious and bonded employment, and mandates fair remuneration, decent
          working hours, and occupational health and safety. It also includes specific safeguards
          for young workers to ensure they are not exposed to exploitative conditions.
