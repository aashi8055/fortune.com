          Halal refers to what is permitted and lawful under Islamic law. In the
          context of food, it signifies items that Muslims are allowed to
          consume. Finding genuine halal food products, particularly outside
          Muslim-majority countries, can be challenging. Even in these countries,
          processed foods often contain non-halal ingredients due to a lack of
          awareness among manufacturers and processors.

          HALAL is an internationally recognized standard that provides a robust
          framework for establishing halal sharia compliance, along with
          essential food safety requirements such as personal hygiene, GMPs,
          infrastructure, and internal audits. While voluntary, halal
          certification is widely requested by international corporations and
          retailers, and is strongly encouraged by governments for market access.

            HALAL Certification Process
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            The certification process begins with a gap analysis conducted by
            quality system experts to assess documentation, traceability,
            ingredient verification, and legal compliance. Organizations then
            implement corrective actions and prepare for audits.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
            A two-stage initial audit is performed by the certification body. Upon
            successful completion, a certificate valid for one year is issued.
            During the three-year certification cycle, two surveillance audits
            (one per year) are conducted, followed by a re-audit to renew
            certification. Continuous adherence to halal standards is essential
            for maintaining validity.
