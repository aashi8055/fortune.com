          ISO 45001 is the international standard for Occupational Health and Safety Management 
          Systems (OHSMS), designed to help organizations implement a structured approach to 
          workplace health and safety or enhance an existing system. Achieving ISO 45001 certification 
          demonstrates an organization's commitment to safeguarding the well-being of its workforce 
          across all operations.

          The certification supports the development of a tailored health and safety framework suited 
          to the specific needs and risks of a business. It enables organizations to identify workplace 
          hazards and implement effective controls, significantly reducing incidents and promoting a 
          culture of safety. ISO 45001 also encourages active participation from employees, increasing 
          risk awareness and ensuring collective responsibility for health and safety.

          Certification helps reduce downtime, lower the costs associated with workplace incidents and 
          insurance premiums, and ultimately enhances the organizationâ€™s reputation through compliance 
          with globally recognized occupational health and safety standards.
